== Theme Description ==
For developers and website owners, Naya Lite is a responsive framework which can perfectly serve as a parent theme if they want to create their own child themes. For bloggers, Naya is a minimal blogging theme that takes their web presence back to the early days of blogging. While Naya Lite’s design justifies the idea of a good old fashioned blog, its features emphasize on being more modern and state-of-the-art. Being both responsive and retina-ready while still maintaining the look of a classic blog, Naya Lite perfectly manages to combine the past and future of blog design.
